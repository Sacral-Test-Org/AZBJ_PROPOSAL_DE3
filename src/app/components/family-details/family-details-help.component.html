  <h2>Help for Entering Family Details</h2>
  <p>To enter family details, please use the following format:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Values should be separated by commas (",").</li>
    <li>Member strings should be separated by semicolons (";").</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The format should include the following details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>V1:</strong> Family member (e.g., M for Mother, F for Father, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>V2:</strong> Health status (e.g., G for Good, D for Died).</li>
    <li><strong>V3:</strong> Age (if the person is deceased, this is the age at death; multiple ages for the same relation can be separated by a hyphen, e.g., "24-27").</li>
    <li><strong>V4:</strong> Life status (e.g., L for LA, P for PH).</li>
    <li><strong>V5:</strong> Cause of death (e.g., D for Diabetes, C for Cancer, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sample string: <code>"F,G,56,L;SI,G,42,P;M,D,54,L,ND;B,G,24-26,P"</code></p>
